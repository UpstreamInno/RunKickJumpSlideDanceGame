# RunKickJumpSlideDanceGame
A little ELM game that experiments with sound tracked sync'd game play action

# Idea

Soundtrack driven game. A game where you get more power/points if you do things in time with the music.

This is not a simple keeping the beat, but rather a level that repleats itself with the same set of obstacles. 
The repitition will force the music into your brain, ear-worm style. And hence you enter a trancelike meditative state
and your actions become fluid and your brain beta-waves sync to the music, and are rewarded for this.

Essentially game is 
- run... run run.. 
- slide under the thing
- jump 
- round kick round kick
- explode

Process 
- listen to the sound track and meditate
- Plan the action timings
- Drive the map and give the character enough hints. like guitar hero..
